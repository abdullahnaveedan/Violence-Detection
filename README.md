# Violence Detection using YOLOv7

## Overview

This project implements a Violence Detection system using the YOLOv7 object detection model. The model has been customized to detect violence-related activities in images and videos.

## Model

The YOLOv7 model used in this project has been customized to detect violence-related objects. Due to privacy policy concerns, the model and dataset are not publicly available.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd violence-detection-yolov7
    ```

## Install Dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Download Pre-trained Weights:
Due to privacy policy, the pre-trained weights are not included in this repository. You need to obtain them separately.

## Run Inference:
python detect.py --source <path-to-images-or-videos>

## Usage:

To use the violence detection model, you can follow these steps:

1. Ensure the necessary dependencies are installed.
2. Download the pre-trained weights and place them in the weights/ directory.
3. Run the detect.py script on your images or videos.

## Results
Due to privacy concerns, we cannot share specific results or images. However, the model is designed to detect violence-related activities with high accuracy.

## Contributing:
This project is not open for external contributions due to privacy and security considerations.

## Acknowledgments:
The YOLOv7 implementation used in this project is based on YOLOv7 repository.
